                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>The Dandy Brewing Company is Calgary's original small brewery. Although it has grown a little, it's still small at heart. We produce inspired ales, with lots of care, in small batches.
                    Our unique approach to brewing and keen eye to every detail and fosters creativity in both our recipes and beer styles.
                   
                    </p>
                <p> On site, we are pleased to offer a unique brewery experience, featuring a full service tasting room with an exquisite menu of fine dining drinking food, a curated selection of cocktails, glass pours of selected wines, and 20 taps of Dandy beers. 
                    We share a passion for not only brewing, but the people, process, experiences, and personal touches that make the real ale experience so special.</p>

        <h1>Story</h1>
        <p>Even dandies have origins.</p>

        <h1>Chef. Chemist. Teacher. Business. </h1>
        <p>The story goes back. Two high-school classmates begin a business, they graduated and went their separate ways. They cross paths again years later to discuss an interest, and a passion. 
            In the fall of 2013, the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission made sweeping changes to the brewing industry in Alberta, allowing small craft breweries to exist. It came at a perfect time. For years Ben Leon, a teacher, and Dylan Nosal, a chef, had been growing their home-brew experience, not only in size but also in knowledge. Over the course of a few years of practice, learning, 
            and many batches, they began brewing exceptional beers on a home-built 1BBL brewhouse. 
        </p>
        <p> While honing skills, the two were developing a keen taste for the growing selection of Craft beer flooding into Alberta. Much of their guidance came from Matt Gaetz, a veteran of the liquor business in Alberta, and a close friend. Between the three of them, the topic of starting something amazing often came up over beers and brewing. They knew they wanted it, they just weren't sure it was possible under old laws. Changes in law meant it was possible. 
            Discussion after discussion, batch after batch, ideas developed into plans. What it always boiled down to was that the brewery would have to be exciting, forward thinking, and outside the traditional thought box for breweries in the province. Exciting beer styles, quality ingredients, and attention to every detail of production.
